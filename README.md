## Project Title: Summarizing categorical data using contingency tables

### Overview: 
In this walkthrough, we will learn a few tools for summarzing categorical data using contingency tables. In addition, we will learn to look at subsets of a dataset defined by a specific variable, using the subset() function. Finally, we will explore the cut() function and the role it plays when transforming a numerical variable into a categorical variable. 


### Sample Data:

The following sample dataset needs to be imported. This can be done directly from RStudio's "Import Dataset" button, or the "read.csv" command.
