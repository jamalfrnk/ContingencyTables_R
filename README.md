## Project Title: Summarizing categorical data using contingency tables

### Overview: 
In this walkthrough, we will learn a few tools for summarzing categorical data using contingency tables. In addition, we will learn to look at subsets of a dataset defined by a specific variable, using the subset() function. Finally, we will explore the cut() function and the role it plays when transforming a numerical variable into a categorical variable.
